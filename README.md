# BetterRest
### Project 4 from #100DaysOfSwiftUI @ hackingWithSwift.com

#### This app uses a Core ML machine learning model trained using Create ML. It shows coffee drinkers their ideal bedtime by asking them 3 questions:

When do you want to wake up?

What's your desired amount of sleep?

What's your daily coffee intake?
